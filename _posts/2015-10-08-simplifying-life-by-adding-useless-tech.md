I ran across an ad for automated window blinds. The slogan was: “Simplify your life with PowerView.” All you’ve got to do is install them and program them. Finally, someone has solved the painful complexity of window shades. I can never get those pesky things to open.

Incidentally, Googling “power view windows” turns up their support link before anything else. Surprised? No. If your window blinds need an FAQ, they are not simplifying your life.

Ah, the Internet of Useless Things. Now [this](http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21651925-robotic-sewing-machine-could-throw-garment-workers-low-cost-countries-out) is more like it. A robotic sewing system. Solving a real problem.

> Socialism and by extension Communism is full of the idea that the ordinary person is incompetent and must be superseded by an official who is also an ordinary person. Their whole philosophy is that a thing should not be done by somebody but by somebody else.
> ~â€‚G.K. Chesterton (The New Witness)

This quarter's list'll be short and sweet. The previous list can be found [here](https://chrisdavies.github.io/blog/programming-resources/2016/09/04/quarterly-good-reads.html).

## [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/)

Don't let the huge font (on a desktop) throw you. It's a good read on the history of the web and its
design trends. There's some good analysis in there.

## [Traditional Japanese Crafts (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3N0EPxNFKDFKHFNhB9YaZw)

These videos are mesmerizing. I always liked when Mr Rogers or Lavar Burton visited factories to show
how stuff was made. These videos are like that, only more zen.

## [War is a Racket](http://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket.shtml)

Written 90 years ago by a decorated US general, this is one of the most thought provoking things I've
read in a while. A quick read that sticks with you.

## [Joel Spolsky on Understanding Developers](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/just-shut-let-devs-concentrate-programming-expert-advises/)

Joel gets it. I can't say how critical this is for HR/managers to undersand. Quiet, focused environments are
the best gift you can give your developers. Distraction-free, private offices or work from home.

## [Tufte Font](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/)

This isn't a read, just a good resource, (maybe I should start calling these entries quarterly
good finds). Anyway, I thought I'd throw this in. It's the font from Tufte's books available as a free
webfont.
